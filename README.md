# CodeClan paired lab Week 8 Day 3
based on the following brief:

## Full-stack Lab: Hotel Bookings
Build a system to allow a hotel to manage bookings. There should be a form to allow the hotel to add the following information for each booking:

- Guest Name
- Guest Email Address
- Checked in status

Bookings should be stored in a MongoDB via an JSON API in Express.

## MVP
- Hotel managers should be able to view a list of all bookings
- Hotel managers should be able to add a new booking, which should update the page without the page being refreshed
- Hotel managers should be able to delete bookings
